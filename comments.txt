"AS seen in my answers i don't need to socialize that much, but taking away the little interaction i had face to face felt really bad. This added to the fact that my exercicing was one of the top things that make me feel good was the two worst things to happen to me.
I'd say this 2 things scalated to all my problems, i have a very high selfsteem,  but i couldnt help feeling myself losing muscle and gaining weight and that hurt me in the way i felt with myself on an emotional level; for example."

Visiting Paris
Work schedule was disrupted. Deadlines were not enforced, as professors tried to be understanding to students who might have been affected by Covid. However, knowing this as a student, invalidates the deadlines and causes immense procrastination. I missed normal working conditions and sense of schedule which impacted other facets of my life.

Not being able to move freely, to got out to new places (I'm in a new country but only for 6 months and I was very eager to discover lots of things but I have been stuck home), to gather with friends.

social interaction 
Meeting physically with friends and enjoying with them at the university. It is very pity of us that we are missing one of the important phases of our masters during this period.
Social interaction, both for personal life and studies. Video-conferences are nowhere near as engaging and effective as physical presence is. I know many universities are planning to continue with remote lessons, and I think this is going be really detrimental to the students' performance and health.
Studying with friends
Hanging out with friends. Dance class. Football practice. Going to a bar. Going clubbing. Most of these are finally coming back now, so it's a lot better now. Still not allowed to go partying and dancing though, which is something I loved to do.
